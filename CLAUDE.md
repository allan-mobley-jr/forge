## Artifacts (in target projects)

All planning artifacts are stored as GitHub issues and comments — not files on disk:

- **Ingot** — One-time GitHub issue labeled `type:ingot`, created by the Smelter on first run. The architectural vision and spec for the project.
- **INGOT.md** — Codebase artifact materialized from the ingot issue by the Blacksmith's first implementation issue. Lives on main after merge.
- **Ledger entries** — tagged comments (e.g., `**[Blacksmith Ledger]**`) on the relevant issue
- **Rework comments** — tagged with `**[Temperer]**`

## Conventions

- Agents use YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`, `tools`
- Each craftsman has two agents: interactive (no `-p`) and auto (with `-p`)
- Agents are invoked via `claude --agent forge:<name>` from the CLI (plugin-namespaced)
- Agents own their label transitions — the CLI only reads state
- Core pipeline agents (Smelter, Blacksmith, Temperer) follow: research → plan → confer/decide → execute → record
- The Temperer uses lean review: reads diff + ledger + INGOT.md + E2E tests (no mandatory Explore/Plan subagents)
- Domain agents at `~/.claude/agents/` are considered during research
- Forge is distributed as a Claude Code plugin (user scope) + CLI (symlinked from ~/.forge/bin)
- Bootstrap steps are idempotent bash functions — each checks precondition before acting
- GitHub labels and issue comments track pipeline state
- Named sessions persist across issues within a milestone for context preservation
- Forge targets Next.js + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript on Vercel — this is intentional scope, not a limitation to fix

## Labels

Target projects use these labels (22 total, defined in `forge-lib.sh`):

- **Meta:** `ai-generated`, `agent:needs-human`
- **Artifact:** `type:ingot`
- **Status:** `status:ready`, `status:hammering`, `status:hammered`, `status:tempering`, `status:tempered`, `status:rework`
- **Type:** `type:bug`, `type:feature`, `type:chore`, `type:refactor`
- **Priority:** `priority:high`, `priority:medium`, `priority:low`
- **Scope:** `scope:ui`, `scope:api`, `scope:data`, `scope:auth`, `scope:infra`, `scope:docs`

When creating issues or PRs for **this repo**, apply relevant labels:

- **Component:** `cli`, `bootstrap`, `agents`, `ci`
- **Type:** `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `refactor`, `chore`

## Pipeline Flow

```
Core:        forge smelt  →  forge hammer  ⇄  forge temper  (repeat per issue)
Post-cycle:  forge hone  →  forge scribe  →  forge proof
```

Each command has an `auto-` variant (e.g., `forge auto-smelt`) for autonomous operation.
`forge stoke` processes the issue queue: dispatches Blacksmith or Temperer based on the oldest issue's status label. Uses named sessions with resume for crash recovery.
`forge cast` runs the full autonomous cycle: smelt → stoke → hone → scribe → proof (repeats if new work emerges).

## Git Workflow

### Atomic commits

**Every commit must be exactly one logical change.** This is non-negotiable.

- One fix per commit. One feature per commit. One refactor per commit.
- If you changed an agent file AND updated docs AND fixed a bootstrap bug, that's three commits — not one.
- If you're about to `git add` files from different concerns, stop and split them.
- Commit early and often. Small commits are easier to review, revert, and bisect.
- Write a short "why" summary on the first line, add detail in the body if needed.

**Test:** Before committing, review the staged diff. Can you describe the change in a single short sentence without "and"? If not, split it.

### After a PR is merged

1. `git checkout main && git pull` — switch to main and pull the merge commit
2. `git branch -d <branch>` — delete the local feature branch
3. `git remote prune origin` — remove the stale remote-tracking ref (GitHub auto-deletes the remote branch on merge)
